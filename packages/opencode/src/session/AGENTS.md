## `message.schema.ts` — `.zod` only needed on union schemas, not individual members

Individual variant schemas (TextPart, SnapshotPart, ToolStatePending, etc.) never have their `.zod` accessed directly. Only the union wrappers (Part, Info, Format, FilePartSource, ToolState) and top-level schemas (User, Assistant) need it — `safeParse` is always called on the union, not on individual variants. Adding `.pipe(withStatics((s) => ({ zod: zod(s) })))` to every variant is wasteful; only the 7 schemas that are actually referenced need it.

## Converting `withStatics` to `Object.assign` requires an intermediate const

When removing `withStatics` from a `Schema.Struct` that still needs `.zod`, you must split into `const _X = Schema.Struct(...)` + `export const X = Object.assign(_X, { zod: zod(_X) })`. The `export const X = Schema.Struct(...)` pattern doesn't allow referencing the schema in its own definition — `Object.assign` needs the schema object before adding `.zod`.
